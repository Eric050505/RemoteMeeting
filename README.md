## Project of SUSTech CS305: Computer Networks, Fall 2024
This project constructs a simple video meeting system in Python that enables participants to communicate over the network using video, audio, and text in real time. The system framework is designed in Client-Server (CS) structure. Meanwhile, this video meeting system relies on several key network protocols (TCP mainly) that enable real-time audio, video, and text communication, which facilitates the smooth transmission of media streams, ensure security, and manage connectivity between participants.
